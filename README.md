## Integrating Outputs

This Terraform configuration manages AWS infrastructure, including VPC, EC2 instances, and security groups. The outputs defined in this configuration provide essential information about the deployed resources, such as instance IDs and public IPs, which can be used for further configurations or integrations.

The outputs from this Terraform setup are essential for integrating with other systems or automating processes, such as:

- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate deployment processes using output values.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Automatically include new instances in monitoring setups using their IDs or IP addresses.
- **DNS Configuration:** Update DNS records with new instance IP addresses.

## Notes

- Ensure sensitive information, like IP addresses or instance IDs, is handled securely.
- When using outputs in scripts or automation tools, update them after each `terraform apply` to reflect the current state.
